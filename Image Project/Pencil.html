<h4>Introduction:</h4>
Both a pen and a pencil are writing instruments. This is not easy to decide which tool is better and worth 
our attention. Their use depends on effects, purposes, and our personal preferences. However, there are activities 
when we prefer pencils to pens and vice versa. WoWPencils is going to consider these situations.


<h4>Pros and Cons of Pencils:</h4>
Graphite pencilsPencils are versatile. They include a graphite or charcoal core and can be used for multiple 
purposes. They have a great advantage over modern permanent handwriting (because computer typing is the permanent 
standard nowadays) â€“ pencils allow easy correction.

Here are some advantages and drawbacks of this writing implement. Using mechanical pencils, we get even more 
bonuses like no sharpening, refillable lead, etc.
<br><br>
<h6>Pros:</h6>
* Can be erased, and mistakes can be removed.<br>
* Great opportunities for drawing and shading<br>
* Wide selection of hardness grade.<br>
* Used to mark any surface (paper, glass, steel, etc.)<br>
* Can be painted over or inked.<br>
* Works at any temperature (either hot or cold).<br>
* The graphite writing is resistant to natural aging, ultraviolet radiation, most chemicals, and moisture.<br>
* Can be broken down into 2-3 pieces and shared with other people.<br>
* Unlike pens, it can be used in space.<br>
* Has a long-term lifespan than that of a pen.<br>
* Cheaper than pens.<br>
<br><br>
<h6>Cons:</h6>
* The manufacturing of wood-based pencils leads to deforestation.<br>
* Can make scratchy sounds when it moves across the paper.<br>
* Makes people prone to making mistakes because they are easy to remove.<br>
* Has to be sharpened regularly.<br>
* The light writing can be difficult to read.<br>
* Hard or impossible to photocopy.<br>
* Becomes shorter after sharpening and requires a pencil extender.<br>
* The pencil is a very popular writing instrument. Unfortunately, our love of wood-cased pencils gradually ruins nature.<br>
* Imagine that a tall pine tree is cut down to produce 2,500 pencils with the worldwide production of more than 14 billion tools a year.<br>

<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages of Pens:</h4>
Pens for writingLongevity and durability are the basic characteristics of pens.
