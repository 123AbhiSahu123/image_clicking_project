    What makes a good table of contents template?</h4>
  It sounds quite simple to just write a list of all the chapters in a book or essay, along with their page
  numbers along dotted lines.

  However, a good table of contents is more than just that. A good table of contents must be perfectly precise,
  ensuring that each page number is accurate. It must be formatted in a clear and concise way so that readers are
  not confused visually. This can be done using simple a heading style, to prevent overwhelming the reader from
  the first page.
  <br><br>
  <h4>Keep the layout simple:</h4>
  It can be tempting to squash each line on the table of contents together to fit it all on one page. However,
  a good table of contents template for a long document will use indents to keep information clear and organized.
  It may even take up more than one page to keep things easy to read.

  A good table of contents template is also visually engaging. Using a colorful table of contents may help your
  document to stand out from other, similar documents, and can help researchers to choose your writing over anotherâ€™s.
  Using a unique heading format, along with a pleasing color, can be a great way to design and customize your table
  of contents template.
  <br><br>
  <h4>How to create a table of contents:</h4>
  There are many types of table of contents and table of contents templates to use. Whether you use MS Word,
  Google Docs or Apple Pages to write your online document, you can edit a table of contents template using any
  of these word processors.
  <br><br>
  <h4>The Basic Format:</h4>
  Depending on your preference, you may opt for a classic, basic table of contents template. This will simply list
  both the heading of each section or chapter of the document, along with the corresponding page numbers along dotted
  lines. This table of contents format is both easy to create and use.
  <br><br>
  <h4>Adding Detail:</h4>
  However, for your table of contents template, you may choose to name individual sections and then write the
  chapters included within that section underneath, using different heading levels.
  This style is still a very simple design for a title page, and I recommend using one of these formats when
  creating your table of contents and using a table of contents template. MS Word, Google Docs and Apple Pages
  all offer these format options.
  <br><br>
  <h5>Using a Table of Contents template (Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages):</h5>
  Using a table of content template helps to eliminate the standard, boring look of a table of contents.
  With a table of contents template, you can simply download and input your data using MS Word, Google Docs or
  Apple Pages.

  Remember, the table of contents is likely the first page that readers will see, so you can engage them further
  by using a unique design for your table of contents page.

  It is likely that many academics have looked at many articles or documents before yours, so using an accessible
  and user-friendly table of contents template will help to keep them engaged in their research and your document.
  <br><br>
  <h4>Creating a manual table of contents:</h4>
  However, you can create a table of contents manually using a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, Google
  Docs or Apple Pages.

  This is an efficient way to create your table of contents, but you are more limited in terms of how visually
  appealing the table will look. The overall table of contents layout is more restricted by what MS Word, Google Docs or
  Apple Pages offers.
