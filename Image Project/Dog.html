  <h4>Introduction:</h4>
  Three out of five houses in India have one or more dogs as a pet animal. The word used for an adult female dog is
  ‘Bitch’. Globally the word ‘ Puppy’ is famous for immature dogs. The dogs cause many viral, bacterial, fungal and
  protozoan diseases. Scientists’ research has found that dogs have originated from the grey wolf. The modern dogs are
  both the herbivorous as well as the carnivorous. The human started breeding the dogs about 9000 years ago.
  <br>
  The initial purpose of breeding dogs included assistance during hunting. The bred dogs were also a way to get rid of
  intense hunger. The dogs have a strong sense of gravitation pull. They can easily experience the intensity of the
  gravitational strength of the Moon. The gravitational pull of Moon at night makes dogs restless, and they start
  barking in the group. The words ‘Pack’ is most often used for a group of dogs.
  <br>
  Like we have different fingerprints, dogs have different nose prints. No two dogs in the world can have the same nose
  prints. The dogs are a kind of jealous animals, and they hate their master playing with some other dog or animal
  instead of them.

  The Dog is a domestic animal. It is most of the often-used animal as a pet. People prefer to have a dog as a pet
  rather than any other animal. The dog serves its master selflessly. All that it wants in return is love and care of
  the owner.

  There are many breeds of dogs available in the world. Every breed has unique qualities and abilities different from
  the other. We can find the dogs all over the world. Some of them as a pet while some other wandering on the road. Some
  wild dogs live only in the forest.
